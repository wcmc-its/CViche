"""Dedup safe-drop guard (#227): deduplicate_entries may only drop an entry
when the loss is provably recoverable — verbatim containment in the kept
entry, full significant-word containment of a token-rich entry, or a fused
multi-record sibling the #221/#225 recovery pass re-verifies. Similarity
scores alone must not drop single-record entries: on 2Q1_ZQ, 7 of 8 such
drops were distinct records lost (distinct degrees, editorial boards,
journal-review rows, multi-part paper series, venue instances).
